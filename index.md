# Welcome

Join us to take a look behind the scenes of an atmospheric research mission flying through Sub-Arctic clouds. We will tell stories from our perspective about why we are crazy enough to board this plane and what is involved in preparing for and conducting these research flights. 

## Who are we?

We are a small research team who participates in the Cold-Air outbreak Experiment in the Sub-Arctic Region (CAESAR). In our normal lives we are researchers University of California, Riverside and the University of Wyoming.
