# Welcome

Join us to take a look behind the scenes of atmospheric research mission flying through Sub-Arctic clouds. We seek to tell some in-depth stories about why we are crazy enough to board these flights and what is all involved in preparing and conducting these flights. 

## Who are we?

We are a small research team who participates in the Cold-Air outbreak Experiment in the Sub-Arctic Region (CAESAR). In our normal lives we are researchers University of California, Riverside and the University of Wyoming.
