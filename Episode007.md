# Sea Spray

[Sea spray aerosol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_spray) is produced by bubbles bursting at the air sea interface. Although it is a common type of aerosol over the oceans that is important for understanding clouds, it's production rate remains uncertain. The physical processes associated with the generation of sea spray are summarized in the Figure below. Breaking waves entrain air, which results in bubbles bursting at the air-sea interface, lofting jet and film drops into the atmosphere, which form sea spray aerosol.

Sea spray production depends strongly on the wind speed. However, the details of the process are complex, as sea spray production rates are also modulated by temperature, salinity, organic components in the sea water, and the presence or absence of the [sea surface microlayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_microlayer).  

During CAESAR we have the opportunity to sample aerosol close to the sea surface and during high wind speeds associated with storms of the cold air outbreaks.

Using a combination of three aerosol size spectrometers we are able to characterize and constrain the aerosol size distribution from 10 to 4000 nm. On one of the flights we sampled aerosol at an altitude of 750 m above ground level for a period of 10 min at wind speed exceeding 20 m/s. Total aerosol number concentration varied between 200 and 400 cm⁻³ and were positively correlated with wind speed. The size distribution shows three main modes, one at 20 nm, one at 150 nm, and one at 2000 nm.

The size distribution (right) is measured by a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), an Ultra-High Sensitivity Aerosol Spectrometer (UHSAS), and a Passive Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer Probe (PCASP).  

Samples at high wind speed and over the remote ocean are rare and thus critical for understanding the sea spray source function and how sea spray controls the boundary layer aerosol budget. Analyzing observations from the size spectrometers in more detail and across multiple research flights will help us quantify the contribution of sea spray emissions to the boundary layer particle burden and the influence of these particles on clouds over this region.
