# Research Flight 1

On Feb 28 it is finally time for our first research flight. At about 9:40 in the morning, the aircraft is moved out of the hangar and hooked up to ground power. At this time, researchers are allowed to board the aircraft and begin pre-flight preparations. Initially, the temperature inside the aircraft is quite cold at about 8Â°C. The people inside the plane and the heat given off by the instruments slowly warm up the inside of the plane. Still gloves are required if you want to hit the right key on the keyboard.

We have about 2 hours for pre-flight preparations. Then the crew splits into flight scientist who stay on board during the research flight and ground scientists who stay back. About 15 minutes before takeoff the ground scientists are booted from the plane and the door is closed. Pilots start the engine and coordinate with air traffic control. Most of the ground crew gathers to wish the plane farewell.
