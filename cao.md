# What is an air mass?

An air mass is a large volume of air that is approximately homogeneous in temperature and moisture. The primary source regions of air masses are the continental Polar (cP), continental Arctic (cA), maritime Tropical (mT), and continental Tropical (cT) regions. Different air masses are separated by frontal boundaries. In the illustration below, the Arctic front separates Arctic from Polar air masses, while the Polar front separates Polar air from warm air masses. The maritime Polar (mP) air masses are secondary air masses that form by the modification of either continental Polar or continental Arctic air as these flow from the continent to the ocean.

    An airmass is a widespread body of air, the properties of which can be identified as 1) having been established while that air was situated over a particular region of the earth's surface (airmass source region), and 2) undergoing specific modifications while in transit away from the source region.
